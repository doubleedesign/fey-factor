> Hypothesis: All the best American TV comedy from the last 20 years exists within 2 degrees[^1] of Tina Fey.

It's like the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon, but for Tina Fey, used to find our next TV comedy binge.

## Why?

As a frequent TV watcher, I often feel plagued by choice paralysis and new content fatigue due to many new shows being so short these days.

My partner and I enjoy American sitcoms and like to watch a couple of episodes of a light-hearted TV show before bed, and given the choice paralysis began to follow person-based trails to find our next show, such as _The Good Place_ -> _Parks and Recreation_[^2]. We began to notice a pattern: a lot of the shows (and to a lesser extent, movies[^3]) we enjoy most: They involved Tina Fey or people who have worked with Tina Fey; or at a stretch, several people who have worked with _those_ people if they hadn't worked with Tina Fey themselves.

He began to suggest shows qualified by statements like "It has a promising Venn diagram" (meaning crossover with Tina Fey shows and/or shows involving Fey collaborators) so I began to wonder...could I actually build the Venn diagram of all of these shows, and use the same logic to find more shows?

I don't remember why I ended up starting with the ranking table and working out ways to rank shows before the actual Venn diagram - maybe because of the sheer amount of data collected when working outwards from Tina Fey - but here we are.

I theorised that in addition to helping us find our next watch, there could be some fun insights to be seen in the data. Maybe it could also answer questions such as "Why do my friends who love _The Good Place_, _Parks and Rec_, and/or _Brooklyn 99_ hate _The Big Bang Theory_?" - maybe Chuck Lorre shows are very far removed from the Tri-Schur area[^4]?

## How?

_// TODO: Briefly explain the criteria, data collection, etc._

---
[^1]: The original hypothesis before I started building this was 3 degrees, but scaling back the amount of data collected when prototyping showed that 2 is a viable hypothesis.
[^2]: I am prepared to concede that the true centre of the Venn diagram (i.e., Degree 0) might actually be Michael Schur.
[^3]: Simply because we watch far more TV than movies.
[^4]: When I began to imagine how diagrams showing the relationships between shows might look, I imagined these three shows in a cluster and nicknamed it the Tri-Schur Area. This was before _A Man On The Inside_ was made.
